An artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .
Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
Generally, I'd anticipate a code bug. Can you paste in your FD_SET and your select calls please?

From the opening scenes , it's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
@F1 Why announcing so late, it will be hard to make it from Manchester and organising a day off. #sad

Here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep .
Suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative .
Hey, I found <url> and at around 1:10, I think I can see the Backstreet Boys holding platinum discs (or double platinum, I'm not sure) for Backstreet's Back and Millennium. Can you please verify and is it possible to use this as a source for adding South African certifications?

Not even proper sentences? Are you currently in an exam?
You could specify whether you need an introduction on applied statistics, or one on (theoretical) statistical inference. I.e., do you want the framework of testing, regression and ANOVA explained or do you want to know what the central limit theorem and the inequality of Chebiyshev have to do with the weak law of large numbers?

As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .

The JJPH ADMIN SEARCH will start on Friday!!! How excited are you?
Maud and Roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .
It's a charming and often affecting journey .
Far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features Nickelodeon has made from its other animated TV series .
A rarity among recent Iranian films : It's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight .

A regular `<img src="URL" />` worked for me, but it was an image that I hosted off-site. That doesn't work for you?
Thanks for the referrence.  Do you have any other response to the Bozo who doubts notability?
Compare the two. How is the first in anyway superior to the second?
I'm sorry I'm not sure do I understand you. Are you looking for something like [OSSTMM](http://www.isecom.org/osstmm/) or the software which would support logistics / management side of the pentesting project?
Where are you using this code? Have you tried `theme_get_setting('logo_path', 'THEME_NAME')`, replacing THEME_NAME with the name of your theme?
Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string-to-int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to "re-convert" the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?
Please ruin this party, @NSWRL. #origin #blues
A deep and meaningful film .
The code you've posted works fine for me.  Are you doing something like `get_simps(get_simps(20))`?
My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor .

Ramsay , as in Ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid .
It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .

This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .

Preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
What an interesting idea. I'll ponder it more. Have you ever seen this done for real?
There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
Sounds interesting. Could people keep me in the loop as well?

@Emtucifor: My point is simply that if you're going to clutch your pearls this tight and go all " _O tempora o mores!_ " on us, it's more convincing if you yourself don't exemplify the decline of standards you are bemoaning.
